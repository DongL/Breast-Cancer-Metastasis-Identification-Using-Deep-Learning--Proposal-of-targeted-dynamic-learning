# Breast Cancer Metastases Identification using Deep Learning

Breast cancer patient if diagnosed in early stage has high 5-year survival rate. However, the tumor grading and cancer staging procedure which involves manually determined by pathologies under microscopes are time-consuming and prone to mistakes. This project proposed a two-staged identification model using deep learning to identify isolated tumor region in whole slide images of H&E stained lymph nodes slides and a targeted dynamic algorithm to strength as well as maintain modelâ€™s accuracy.
